README
The folder should be contain the following files:
hw7.R: Script containing code used for homework 7
Homework7Report.pdf: The homework report
group.txt

In order to run hw7.R you must have glmnet installed.
1) Run sections in the code from top to bottom. 
2) I have some comments in ALL CAPS that allow the graders to manipulate the code.
It allows me to remove repeated lines of code or code that may take too much time
(i.e. cross-validating to find the optimal scale). 
For example, the line below currently runs elastic net with alpha = 0.5.

#CHANGE GLMNET PARAMETERS HERE
tempModel = cv.glmnet(newTrGramMat, trTemp, alpha = 0.50) #temperature model

You can change the line to the following in order to train the lasso model.

#CHANGE GLMNET PARAMETERS HERE
tempModel = cv.glmnet(newTrGramMat, trTemp, alpha = 1) #temperature model
