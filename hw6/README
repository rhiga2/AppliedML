README

The directory should contain:
Homework6Report.pdf
hw6_1.R: Linear Regression
hw6_2.R: Logistic Regression

Instructions to run:
1. Set working directory to a directory that contains the data.
Note: For question 1, I used the dataset with chromatic features. 
Note: that for question 2, I changed the format from .xls to .csv so that I could read the data with the function read.csv.
2. The code in both R files run sequentially, meaning that you have to run code above before trying to run code below. Other than that there are no restrictions on how to run the code.
