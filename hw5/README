How to Cluster Text Files:
1. Run hw5multinomial.py 
2. Run hw5doc_cluster.py. Make sure that docword.nips.txt and vocab.nips.txt are within the same directory.

How to Segment Image:
1. Run hw5gauss.py
2. Run hw5seg_image.py. It will ask you for three inputs.
	a. the path of the image file you want to cluster.
	b. the number of clusters you want to segment the image into. After this step the code will run the EM algorithm which might take a while.
	c. after finishing the em algorithm, you will need to output the name of the output file.
