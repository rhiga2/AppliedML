The files contained in this directory are:
group.txt - list of group members.
cifar10 - directory containing cifar10 code.
	cifar10_train.py - runs the training procedure.
	cifar10_eval.py - runs the evaluation procedure.
	cifar10_part4.py - contains my modified ncifar10 neural network.
	all other files are unmodified from the tensorflow github code.
mnist
	mnist_functions.py - contains function necessary for training in part 1 and part2.
	trainPt1.py - contains code from part 1.
	trainPt2.py - contains code from part2.

Mnist Execution
1. Make sure both training files, trainPt1.py and trainPt2.py, can find mnist_functions.py. Theese files should all be within the same directory so it should not be a problem.

2. Run trainPt1 to generate the model for part 1. You can change the logdirectory within the script to change the location of the logged tensorboard data; the relevant variable is named logdir.

3. Run trainPt1 to generate the model for part 2. You can change the logdirectory within the script to change the location of the logged tensorboard data; the relevant variable is named logdir.

Cifar10 Execution
1. Both part 3 and 4 use the same code with minor changes. Makes sure that if you running part 4 that the train and evaluation scripts (cifar10_train.py and cifar10_eval.py) can find the script cifar10_part4.py. They should all be in the same directory by default.

2. Depending if you are running part 3 or part 4 change the following line in both files.
If you are running part 3, change the top line to:
'''
GLOBAL CONSTANT: CHANGE IF RUNNING PART 3 VS. PART 4
'''
INFERENCE = cifar10.inference

If you are running part 4, change the top line to: 
'''
GLOBAL CONSTANT: CHANGE IF RUNNING PART 3 VS. PART 4
'''
INFERENCE = cifar10_part4.myinference

cifar10_part4.myinference is a function I wrote in cifar10_part4.py that contains my modified convolutional neural network.

2. Run cifar10_train.py and cifar10_eval.py simultaneously.
